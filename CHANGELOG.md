- Detailed exit code documentation
- Feature comparison with GNU timeout
- Installation instructions for multiple methods
- Contributing guidelines and issue reporting information

### Testing

## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first stable release of timeout-cli, providing a reliable alternative to GNU timeout with the following key capabilities:

- **GNU Compatibility**: Implements core GNU timeout features including proper exit codes and kill-after functionality
- **Robust Process Management**: Reliable SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation for stubborn processes
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with appropriate signal handling
- **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability across different scenarios
- **Easy Installation**: Available via cargo-binstall for fast binary installation

The implementation focuses on reliability and compatibility, making it suitable for shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and system administration tasks where process timeout management is critical.
